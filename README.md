# ðŸ“¢ **MOEXHAWK**
The **MOEXHAWK V1.0.2 Baseboard** is a versatile single-board platform that combines a swappable Pixhawk flight controller and the Raspberry Pi CM4 companion computer. This baseboard offers a compact design, integrating all essential development connections in one place. It facilitates a smooth experience for developers needing an efficient and integrated solution for UAV or robotics projects.

It follows the [Pixhawk Connector](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf) and [Autopilot Bus Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-010%20Pixhawk%20Autopilot%20Bus%20Standard.pdf), allowing easy swap of FC Module with any FC that follows the Pixhawk Bus Standard.
